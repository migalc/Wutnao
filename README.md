## 1. What is it ?

A small venture into SwiftUI which is basically an iOS app that detects text from a video input and shows the translated version in the detection box. 

## 2. Used frameworks

- Combine
- SwiftUI
- Firebase ML Kit - [Reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit)
- Shank - [Reference](https://github.com/ZamzamInc/Shank/)

## 3. Prerequisites

- Xcode 11
- Swift 5.1
- Cocoapods - that is until Firebase provides the ML Kit in the Swift PM.


## 4. TODOs

- Provide the choice to pick the source and translation languages. For the moment, it is only EN -> PT.
- Use the Firebase Cloud translation services. For the moment, all the translations are done on-device.
- What else ?
